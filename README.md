# R Programming Scripts and Visualizations

This repository contains R scripts and corresponding visualizations created during my learning journey in R programming. These scripts demonstrate data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using R's built-in datasets such as `cars` and `starwars`.

## Overview of Files

### Scripts
1. **`cars.R`**
   - **Dataset**: Built-in R dataset `cars`.
   - **Purpose**: 
     - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset.
     - Visualized the relationship between car speed and stopping distance.
     - Gained insights into potential patterns and trends.

2. **`cleaning_data_starwars.R`**
   - **Dataset**: Built-in R dataset `starwars`.
   - **Purpose**:
     - Focused on data cleaning and transformation.
     - Managed missing data and created summaries of character attributes.
     - Extracted meaningful insights for visualization.

### Visualizations
1. **Speed vs. Stopping Distance (`cars.R`)**
   - This scatterplot illustrates the relationship between the speed of cars and their stopping distance.

2. **Star Wars Character Summary (`cleaning_data_starwars.R`)**
   - This bar chart highlights key attributes of Star Wars characters, showcasing the distribution of specific traits.

## How to Run the Scripts

1. Open the `.R` files in RStudio or any R-compatible IDE.
2. Ensure that required libraries (e.g., `tidyverse`) are installed.
3. Run the scripts interactively to generate outputs and visualizations.
